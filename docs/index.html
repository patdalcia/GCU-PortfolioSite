          <text class="appNameText">Organized</text> is an organizational tool
          made for students, by a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by online University Portals,
          <text class="appNameText">Organized</text> aims to provide students
          with a central dashboard where their Course information can be easily
          viewed and organized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Course and Assignment detials at a glance. Automatically groups
          assignments that are due soon. All displayed in a simple and easy to
          use Interface that streamlines the organizational process.

          This project was made as a
          <a href="https://www.gcu.edu/">Grand Canyon University</a>(GCU) senior
          project. The author of this application, and this portfolio site, is
          Patrick Vidal Garcia. The creation of the
          <text class="appNameText">Organized</text> app, and its necessary
          documentation, were created over the span of two courses: CST-451, and
          CST-452. This portfolio site is used to display the final application
          state, and provide details into its design, and development. To see
          all documentation for this project, please refer to the

          The modern student faces many challenges. Balancing school, work, and
          life is no easy task. For this to properly be accomplished, students
          must get organized. While traditional organizational tactics, like day
          planners, calendars, etc., are effective for some students. Others may
          opt for a more digital approach. There are a litany of applications
          that offer organizational tools. However, many of these applications
          are not free, or are simply bloated with unnecessary features.
          Students must be provided with a clear and simple UI, and clearly
          outlined and useful features to encourage them to actually utilize the
          app for its intended purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the aim of this project to create a tool that students may use
          to help them organize their schoolwork to ensure nothing falls through
          the cracks. As stated in the previous paragraph, there are many tools
          already on the market for organizing daily events, and even
          schoolwork. However I felt their interfaces and features resulted in
          an unpleasant user experience, that eventually led to the application
          being removed from my devices unused. Taking inspiration from the
          Grand Canyon University LoudCloud portal, this application will
          display a student's upcoming assignment clearly, and even provide
          alerts when due dates are close. Students can add course details, and
          past courses will be automatically organized to provide easy access
          for later use. Simplicity and function are the key points here. As
          someone who has a hard time committing themselves to organizational
          tools, I aim to create something that even I will love using.

        <h3>Design Details</h3>
        <p>
          <text class="appNameText">Organized</text> was built using the Windows
          Presentation Framework(WPF). This framework utilizes a combination of
          C# and XAML to create responsive desktop applications. The goal of
          this app, is to create an application that can operate on a users
          computer without the need for an internet connection. This meant that
          webapps were out, and a desktop application would be the correct
          route. I narrowed down my options to three popular frameworks: WPF,
          Swing, and Electron JS. While all powerful choices, I opted for WPF,
          mainley due to my familiarity with the framework aquired through
          previous courses. There are other benefits that made WPF the correct
          choice, mainly its Data Binding capabilites, and its hierarchical GUI
          strucutures. WPF is also an established and well documented framework,
          making it the ideal choice for my app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using WPF, this app was created following the Model View ViewModel
          (MVVM) pattern. A model is created (ex. Course.cs, Assignment.cs) to
          store object data. This object data is then used to update View Models
          (CourseViewModel.cs, AssignmentViewModel.cs) , classes that are used
          as data sources for the View layers GUI elements. Because the View
          layers GUI elements are bound to a View Model, any changes made to
          either the View Model, or the controls that are bound to them, are
          automatically reflected in the GUI elements. This results in fast and
          responsive layouts, that are perfect for storing the kind of data
          needed for this app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking of data, the original intentions of this application were to
          store Course and User data within a relational database (ex. SQL). Due
          to time-constraints and poor planning-ironic when developing an app
          that improves organization- the data of this application is instead
          stored locally within JSON encoded files. This app does not need to
          store large amounts of data, and the data itself is simple Course and
          Assignment details that do not need to be secured yet. Future
          iterations of this app will include more robust data security, most
          likely involving a SQL database. User authentication will also be
          included to allow for additional user settings and information, while
          securing said information.
